        <p>A good example of a paragraph contains a topic sentence, details and a conclusion.
            'There are many different kinds of animals that live in China.
            Tigers and leopards are animals that live in China's forests in the north. In the jungles,
            monkeys swing in the trees and elephants walk through the brush.

        <p>Granovetter begins by looking at balance theory. If an actor, A, is strongly tied to both B and C, it is extremely likely that B and C are,
            sooner or later, going to be tied to each other, according to balance theory (1973:1363).
            Bridge ties between cliques are always weak ties, Granovetter argues (1973:1364).
            Weak ties may not necessarily be bridges, but Granovetter argues that bridges will be weak.
            If two actors share a strong tie, they will draw in their other strong relations and will eventually form a clique.
            Only weak ties that do not have the strength to draw together all the “friends of friends” can connect people in different cliques</p>
