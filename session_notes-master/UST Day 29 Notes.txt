UST Day 29

Recap

hello APIView DRF
Serializer - for validation and providing input fields
urls on api and project
we bind a serializer with the view

We will start with a new model (independent)
to create independent model we have to derive from 
AbstractBaseUser is already derived from models.model

model will have many properties 
Book - title author 
Using ORM,
migrate - it will create a table - columns - title author

On admin portal we can manage all registered models
as well as we can manage database using inbuilt 
database API using shell 

How many mode we have ? 1 UserProfile
Why we created UserProfile model? to add more properties

HelloSerializer is not using any model
we can handle request and response without any model

model = class (contains many properties)
create a __str__ to string represent object 

1
serializer is again defining validation rules 
that we already defined in models level
I have to write validation for every property of model class


ModelSerializer

2
APIView
right now we are creating all http methods for endpoints
is it possible to create all the http methods automatically

till now we are using APIView
Yes - using ViewSet we can achieve this

We are unable to create object using model 
Serialization should be different for that


Point of concern
Every time we have to create a new angular project
ng new new-app
we have to install everything

Sol - Create a template project from existing running project
 



Practice 
Create a model Employee (Id, Name, Salary, Projects[] )
