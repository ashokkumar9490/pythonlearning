UST Capstone Projects

Project Implementations

Document is a Guideline to the project - 
You are allowed to change or add any requirement with discussion 
None of the requirement is mandatory or to be done as it is

Start from minimal requirements 
Whatever you implement, should be perfect

rather than implementing 10 requirements - start with 5 fully implemented
UI wise and functionality wise

at least one API using flask
rest user defined APIs using Django
at least one external API 	


Form should be there in every project with proper validation

Integration will be a challenge.

We should use 2 databases at least - SQLite MySQL and MongoDB
