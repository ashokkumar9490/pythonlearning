Exception Handling

try:
	statements

exception:  (multiple)


	exception IOError:

we can handle multiple exceptions in the same block

except without any exception name

except: will handle all not handled exceptions

only at end of exception handlers 


ValueError it is exception class 
is it derived from any other class? Exception

built in exception class
user defined exceptions - SalaryRangeException(Exception)
we can raise an exception 






statement will raise the exception 
raise exception (built in OR user defined)


else:

finally:


traceback - want to see all line numbers from where exception initiated and 
where it is handled

import traceback

print(traceback.exc())

File Handling

Text File  		.txt   human readable
Binary File		not human readable .jpg .bin . 

f = open("file1.txt")

f.read() will read whole file content
f.read(10)

windows what is new line?


line1			\n\r		\n		encoding
line2
line3

Do we have to implement inheritance?  NO   
 add data to lists, dictionaries
