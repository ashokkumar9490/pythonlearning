Day 36 Notes

Recap 

We started with simple collection - 
Id was missing 
we are creating nested collection
we can;t create table inside table - to handle that issue
remove nesting of collection
create separate collection - reference 
input data should have expected keys 
(if we pass itemname in place of name, will be KeyError)

We started with List of Stores

@app.route("/greeting")	

is equivalent to
@app.get("/greeting")

And since ["GET"] is the default, this is equivalent to
@app.route("/greeting", methods=["GET"])


Today will start with same type of API but with more validation
and more methods - PUT DELETE

I want to change collection concept
In table PK will have number and it is autoincremental

1 store1 
2 store2

in dictionary I want to add id automatically as a unique values
uuid to generate always new unique ids

In third step we will implement Marshmallow 
swagger-ui is standard for API documentation
It will be created automatically with the use of Marshmallow
We have to provide some configurations
