Test Driven Development
Test case(s) - fail 
Write good code 
Run test - may be fail 
improve code - all test cases passed 
First write the test case(s)
boundary case >60 >=60

Git Why? versioning  
	sharing
	collaborating

How to check installed?
git --version

distributed 

how to use my repo on my laptop?
Created repo - copied https url for cloning
1 clone it 
	git clone repourl
2 add content
	add a text file
3 add to versioning
	git add .
4 commit the changes locally 
	git commit -m "commit1"
5 push
	git push -u origin master
6 Sharing
	add members to the repo with roles
	Repo - Project Information - Members
7 add more content
	




Can we start with local repo 
create a folder in laptop 
and push it to git repo - YES


.git 


git init
added a file

I want to share with others 
git remote add origin https://gitlab-ust.stackroute.in/sharad.singh/testgit2.git
git push -u origin master

Programming Concepts

strongly typed language   C# Java
				int c=10;
					c=20;

variables 
 		a = 11		type(a)
		a = 12.5	type(a)
		a = "abcd"	type(a)

Conversion 		
Round 		


constant 		fixed value "India"
				1947 
				1234.56
data types 
operators
	expression        operators and operands
		x = x + 5		arithmatical 		
		print(2**5)

relational operators and or 
		if 5<6 or 7<6:								print("ok")

T or T 	=	T		
T or F  = 	T

constructs 
conditional if if-else  if-elif-else  
		switch 
iterations looping - doing something multiple times

	for 		how many times?
	while (T)
		when to use it
	for each	collection 
	
	i=1
	while i<10
		print(i)
		i = i + 1


	infinite value 

Stop execution Ctrl+C

errors - syntax error 
		

	compiler 
	interpreter 

	logical error  - how to correct? debugging 

		print log 
		debugging techniques 
		breakpoint 
		
	String		method()	and property (identify)
			behaviour	

person1.name = "Sharad"
person1.Sleep()

Sleep()

why we create function?
	to reuse code 


	functions  can be called  funcname(arg)


class 
  OOPS method (function)





			Person	Name Age 

Entity Noun 		Visible  Person, Laptop, Car 
			Account 

OOPS 

	Data Structure
		linear data structure 
		Array list 
		
	File Handling

	Packages - reuse - library  for reference 
		set of functions may be reused in many projects
