UST Day 17

Recap
Angular

Roundtrip Application   
SPA

check installation - ng version
create folder ngworkspace
under that created a project / angular application

ng new ng-app 

ng new --no-standalone ng-app 



2016 - angularjs 
angular2
angular 17 
till angular 16 older logo shield logo was used 
version 17 they have removed the requirement of importing and declaring in app.module
new logo is there for angular 17


to run the application - ng serve -o

open 2 cmd windows - one for running application 
2nd for creating components and other objects

Create a component - ng generate component hello
OR 		ng g c hello

Services are also required - ng g s service1

html w3c

every new component will be created in separate folder with component name
having 4 files .ts .spec.ts .html .css

How app component is displayed? In index.html - <app-root>
In component ts file it is defined as selector.

to use a component - we have to use its tag-name <app-hello>

app- is added to/ prefixed to component name in selector 

Component is a class decorated with @Component decorator
	selector
	templateURL
	styleURL
We want to use new component - parent component can use child component
Where to use it? We will use it in app component - 


Create one more component - welcome

Parent component - app-root

2 child components - hello and welcome
always run angular application using ng serve command

If I have to remove any component - 
	delete the folder
	remove the <tag> used in parent component

Module and component 

An angular application will have at least one module
that module can have 1 or more components

components are registered in app.module.ts file
another file is there app-routing.module.ts
From app.module.ts remove import of component and declaration of component
In case we have to change app.module.ts
restart your application

Most of the languages use this pattern - Dependency Injection

Design Pattern - Well defined solution to well know development problems
GOF - create a set of design patterns 

Singlelon Pattern - developer want a single object can be created for a class

OOPS

We create a class  - it has dependency of other class objects

		suppose that dependent class is changed,

class MainClass:

	obj1 = Interface1 - Class11()		create objects of interfaces here

	obj2 = Interface2 -  Class2()			


Container Program - Interfaces will be linked with classes

don;t create the objects of classes inside the main class

create them in a container 

interfaces  Java 

In .NET and Java - they don;t support multiple inheritance 
we can not derive from more than one class

interface in place of classes
interfaces are set of abstract methods - without any logic / implementations

obj1 = new Class1()		Person	
class2(Class1)			Student

obj2 = Class2
obj1 = obj2

interface1 = Class1
Class3(Class2 + Interface3)
i1 = Interface1

obj3 = Class3
i1 = obj3
change Class1 to Class11
Build a house - Floor - Rooms - Every room need window and gate - frame 

Why we are discussing in Angular - Dependency

communication from component to template
Component - myName:string="Sharad"
Template - Binding -  {{ myName }}
text-interpolation

communication - from template to component
in html what we can do? to be handled in component.
event binding - click in normal onclick="DoSomething()"
in angular syntax is (click)="SayHello()"

Directives - Structural Directives - looping *ngFor , conditional *ngIf

How to use bootstrap on Angular - using CDN 

using npm i bootstrap

Open angular.json and insert a new entry into the styles array:

"styles": [
"styles.css",
"../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
],


<router-outlet /> will be used for angular routing


In project there is a file styles.css 
used for global styling


angular pipes | - are used for some formatting 
uppercase, lowercase, or applying currency formats



,
styles             "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
scripts 	"node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"

On table apply thead and tbody sections to apply bootstrap colors

For Bootstrap using CDN and 
npm uninstall bootstrap


I don't want to display components by default
I want to populate them on menu click

routing 

commented component calls from app.component.html

we have to modify routing file - app-routing.module.ts

In Routes array add paths

ng add @angular/material

import { MatBadgeModule } from '@angular/material/badge';
import { MatSlideToggleModule } from '@angular/material/slide-toggle';
import { MatIconModule } from '@angular/material/icon';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, HelloComponent, WelcomeComponent],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
    FormsModule,
    MatBadgeModule,
    MatSlideToggleModule,
    MatIconModule,
  ],


<mat-slide-toggle>Toggle me!</mat-slide-toggle>
<br />
<mat-icon
  aria-hidden="false"
  aria-label="Example home icon"
  fontIcon="home"

remove from angular.json styles-
