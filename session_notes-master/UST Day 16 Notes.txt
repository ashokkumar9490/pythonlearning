UST Day 16

Recap

anonymous
In Built Functions on String, Arrays, Maths etc
Callback
class OOPS

2 Todo List, exercises Bootstrap 

4 step learning 

1 watch session
2 repeat it
3 do it yourself
4 experiment on it

promise
sync call
async calls - when function may take considerable time 
		and may return a promise

async-await pattern

async function asyncFunction{
statements;
await doSomething() // will take time
will continue when promise is resolved
}


asyncFunction()
doSomethingElse()


Create Interview Questions
Create some MCQ as well 

javscript API calls - 

Application Programming Interface 

API - did we used String API yesterday? YES

windows API  set of methods of functions 
document.getElemByID()

FSD API backend development -  REST API - REST is set of rules - 6 rules 
http methods - GET, POST, Update, Delete

FrontEnd will be to call API format and display

databases - CRUD -  Create Retrieve Update Delete 
backend developer 
end user - needs data and its manipulation CRUD

GET data in different ways - REST API

<form action="serversideprogram.php" method="Get" >

Postman - apiTesting

Testing - AAA -  Arrange Act Assert
Arrange create testing env  

expected value

Act - we have to call required functionality to get actual value

Assert - compare them



npm install --save-dev mocha@10.1.0
npm install chai@4.3.6

Typescript
Angular

mocha './specs/*.spec.js'


var salary = 100000
salary="abcd"

Transpilation

NGWorkspace

To create a new Angular application

ng new --no-standalone ng-app
>cd ng-app
>ng serve -o

port 4200 http://localhost:4200

open the project in VSCode
src folder contains the main app
index.html only html file 
it has only 1 tag <app-root></app-root>


at least 1 module and component(s)

app folder contains module and its components

module file name is app.module.ts
an angular component is created using 4 files
.ts  .html  .css () .spec.ts (testing)

all components will be used using tag 

every compoent is a class with decorator @Component
selector - tag-name
templateURL - component html
if no separate file, provide template here only
template: ``

Why Angular? to create SPA 
Why Components

Componentize an application 

Create a new component and use it

ng generate component hello







app
