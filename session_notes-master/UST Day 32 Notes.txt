UST Day 32

Recap

Created UserProfile with persmissions
so that only logged in user could update own profile, not for others
however, get all and post is allowed as SAFE_METHDOS for any login as of now

connected the django backend with angular
login service method expects to pass userid and password in body section
using service getting token after login 
for further requests have to pass token in header to allow access of api

Today we will add a new api for Feeds that is 1 to many relation with profile
e.g. a profile can have many feeds 


DateTime        (Today system date time may be ignored) date       Now (Date and Time)

DBMS on Delete clause

Foreign key name and primary key name can be different

Will admin delete the foreign key data from all the related tables manually - NO
What is the option? On Delete Trigger will be create

trigger is like an auto executing server side function
whenever an event happens that function will run

Cascade - related data should be updated automatically
cascade update
cascade delete - delete PK record, FK records from all tables will deleted automatically

Oracle - PLSQL  -  Loops If 
Can a table have multiple foreign keys - YES

SQL Query as string - what are drawbacks - Not a preferred way of executing -
Parsing and validation is done everytime we are trying to execute on server
then server engine creates a query execution plan -
What indexes to be used for faster execution?

SQL Injection - Security Threat  

var project1 = "Google; delete * from Projects";

"Delete employee where project = " + Google; delete * from Projects + " and employee name = " + empname
  
What are DBMS Tables indexes?  
Most databases create index on PK column 

Book has an Index    - at end of the book  

topic name - pages    Primary Key 1 , 15,  156  245
we don;t have to read all pages of the book to read one topic 
 
From Leaves table     display leaves of empid 100 lacks of records 
serial searching - slow

On leaves table better create an index on foriegn key column
1 - 1,145,3456,45665

db admin - to create indexes as per usage 

Select * from Employees

On migration all models changes are handled.
