javaScript - Why to use it?

	Web Designing client side coding as well as for server side coding 
	Client side coding for behaviour in Web Page
	e.g. on click want to perform something

What we need as software?
We can run javascript on browser and Node 

Developer's tool - Inspect - Console Tab - write commands - Ctrl+Shift+I


Where to write javascript? 
Along with html - <script> internally
where to write <script> tag - head or body

in script tag we can write statements or functions
snippet 

Bootstrap CDN - css in head js in end of body
using .js file externally

console.log('Working')
we are not working on command prompt - is we work using node, we can run a program there

javascript variables - var let const

EcmaScript6 2015 
TypeScript

var (global scope variable) let (block scoped variable)

try to use let more

int x=10


javascript formatting extension - prettier

javascript is different from Java , C C++ , C#  
create block using { statements }
python function naming convention - snake case say_hello   
function sayHello(){			camel case
}
function will not run automatically -  we have to call it.
on any event we can call function or we can call directly
statements may terminate with ; not mandatory - good practice to use it
def hello():
	print('Hello')

event - OOPS - data members (attributes), methods (behavior), events (event handler) 
Web Design - event - load (Body Load)

control event - button click
we can have multiple <script> in a section

javascript error like log will appear in console 

want to get function created in separate file and make it available on the page 
external js file


javascript as a language

constant/literals
variables
I/O 
constructs - looping, decision making, sequential, 
built-in function  - string 
arrays
premitive data types - number, string, boolean,

NaN  Not a Number
undefined ( variable not initialized )

case sensitive   boolean true / false
null is not zero 
database  table column null value

==   equality 
=== equality with type checking

if condition   - python
if (10 == "10"){				euqal   auto type conversion
	console.log("equal")
}
else{
	console.log("not equal")
}


Create a simple calculator

debugging of javascript code

case studies 
user stories - task 

as a user i should be able to get textbox with red background if the input value is non-numeric

Where to write 

textbox having non-numeric value should be red colored

leaving a textbox - text1 leave - blur  text2 is active focus  blur 

Implement 

Loops    while  do-while  for    for-of   foreach

to apply nested loop - Flags    display on browser

display some value in textbox
display something on change content of <p>


String(val)
formatted string			`Sum = ${sum}` 

let num =prompt("Enter a number")
		
callback function
promise - 
fetch fetching data from API
