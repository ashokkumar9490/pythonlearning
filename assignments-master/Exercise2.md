### Python - Exercise-2  

## Create A python program to practice Loops. This exercise involves creating a function called play_guessing_game that simulates a number guessing game.

**Function: `play_guessing_game(secret_number, attempts)**

Parameters:

secret_number: An integer representing the secret number to be guessed.  
attempts: An integer representing the maximum number of allowed guesses.  

Returns:  
None (The function prints messages and interacts with the user during game play)  

Sample Usage:  
play_guessing_game(secret_number=42, attempts=5)  # Example usage with default values  

Challenge:  
Modify the game to provide hints based on the difference between the guess and the secret number (e.g., "Too high!" or "Getting closer!").
Extend the game to dynamically generate the secret number within a specific range based on user input.
